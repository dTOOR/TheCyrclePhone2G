<p>These are the enclosure files for the The Cyrcle Phone 2G which was featured in a successful 2016 Kickstarter campaign by dTOOR. (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dtoor/make-your-own-cyrcle-phone).</p>

3D Printing Tips:<br>
The walls are really thick, so no supports are needed. <br>

Assembly tips:<br>
- You will need a wire for the hinge pin. A jumbo paper clip, cut to size works well.
- Place the insert onto the base, and then add the lid, keeping the lid closed.
- Insert the jumbo paper clip through the connecting holes, mark where you need to cut it, remove it, cut it, and reinsert it.
- Add glue (wood glue or glue stick works well because it dries clear) to either ends of the wire, and wipe away excess glue with a tissue.
- Let dry overnight.
- Insert assembled Rephone Kit Create by Seeed Studio, cutting paper to fit inside the base.
- Enjoy your new round phone!
